Good morning Javier. Japan is heading to the polls today in what's shaping up to be a pivotal election for Prime Minister Takaichi's political future, while a major winter storm batters the country and Japanese athletes are already making Olympic history in Milan.

The [Lower House election](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2026/02/08/japan/politics/voters-head-to-polls/) began this morning at 44,000 polling stations across the country, with Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party setting expectations low by aiming only for a simple majority with their Japan Innovation Party coalition partners. The Japan Times notes this is being viewed as a referendum on Takaichi's leadership, coming after significant shifts in the opposition landscape. Meanwhile, [severe weather](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260208/k10015046081000.html) is complicating voting day, with the Japan Meteorological Agency issuing heavy snow warnings for Tottori Prefecture, where 30 centimeters fell in just six hours this morning. [Snow accumulation](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260208/k10015046071000.html) is affecting even central Tokyo, with NHK warning of major transportation disruptions and urging caution on icy roads.

On a brighter note, Japan got off to a spectacular start at the Milano-Cortina Olympics with a historic double medal sweep. First-time Olympian [Kimura Aoi won](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260208/k10015046001000.html) Japan's first gold of the games in men's snowboard big air, while compatriot Kimata Ryuma claimed silver in the same event. Hours later, [Maruyama Nozomi captured bronze](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260208/k10015045921000.html) in women's ski jumping normal hill, also in her Olympic debut.
