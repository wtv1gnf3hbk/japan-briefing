The [Milan-Cortina Olympics](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260207/k10015045461000.html) officially opened yesterday with Japan's delegation marching in the unprecedented four-venue ceremony. Speed skater Mori Shigeko and snowboarder Tomita Sena carried Japan's flags as the games launched across Milan and Cortina simultaneously. Japan is already making moves in figure skating, with [Sakamoto Kaori](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260207/k10015045411000.html) topping the women's short program to help the team event squad climb to second place heading into the final discipline.

Back home, Japan faces its final day of campaigning before tomorrow's [general election](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260207/k10015045271000.html), with party leaders making last-ditch appeals in swing districts. The timing is challenging as a winter storm system is bringing heavy snow to the Sea of Japan coast through Monday, with [Tokyo potentially](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260207/k10015045311000.html) seeing accumulation that could complicate voting logistics. The weather agency is warning of transport disruptions just as voters head to the polls.
