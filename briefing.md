Good morning. Japan had its Olympic moment overnight at Milano-Cortina, but it came with a touch of what-might-have-been. Kaori Sakamoto [won silver](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260220/k10015056611000.html) in women's figure skating, falling just short of gold in what NHK World calls her final Winter Games appearance. The 17-year-old Ami Nakai [claimed bronze](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260220/k10015056611000.html), giving Japan two spots on the podium but missing the clean sweep that felt within reach. American Liu took the top prize, according to [Japan Times](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/olympics/2026/02/20/womens-free-skate-milano-cortina/).

On the medical front, Japan is poised to make history with what could be the world's [first commercial](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260220/k10015056521000.html) iPS cell treatments. A health ministry panel yesterday approved two regenerative medicine products for manufacturing and sale. If formally approved, this would mark the practical realization of Shinya Yamanaka's Nobel Prize-winning research, though experts warn Japan faces stiff competition in maintaining its edge in regenerative medicine.

**Coverage Flags**

The iPS cell approval appears to be getting more detailed coverage in Japanese outlets than international press, potentially worth deeper NYT exploration given the global implications for regenerative medicine competition.
