Good morning, Javier. The Abe assassination case is back in the headlines as [defense lawyers](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260204/k10015043001000.html) for Tetsuya Yamagami filed an appeal against his life sentence yesterday. This marks a significant development in Japan's most politically consequential crime in decades. The appeal suggests the defense will continue challenging the court's rejection of their mental health arguments, potentially extending this case's grip on the national psyche well into 2026.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi appears to be successfully courting younger voters who felt abandoned by previous administrations. The Japan Times reports her strategy of [positioning herself](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2026/02/04/japan/politics/sanae-takaichi-young-voters/) as a break from the old guard is resonating with Japan's youth. This is notable given traditional LDP struggles with younger demographics and could signal a generational shift in Japanese politics worth monitoring.

**Business & Markets**
• [Prudential Life](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260204/k10015042991000.html) is suspending new policy sales for 90 days starting February 9, after staff defrauded customers of ¥3.1 billion. The insurer says it needs to overhaul governance and sales systems completely.

• A [job placement scam](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260204/k10015042871000.html) involving "Momuri" retirement services has exposed fake labor unions used to disguise illegal referral fees to lawyers, per NHK. Police suspect the union structure was entirely fabricated.

**What to Watch**
NASA has [delayed](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260204/k10015043031000.html) the Artemis mission launch until next month due to fuel leaks during final testing. Japan is a key partner in this moon exploration program, so any further delays could affect JAXA's timeline.

**Flag:** The Japan Times piece on Takaichi and young voters offers English-language analysis that goes beyond what Japanese outlets are providing. This generational appeal angle might warrant deeper NYT coverage, especially given how it could reshape Japanese politics.
