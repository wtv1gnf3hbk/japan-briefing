Good morning. Japan woke up to a dramatically reshaped political landscape after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party achieved what analysts are calling a [historic landslide](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260208/k10015046481000.html) in Sunday's lower house election. The LDP secured [316 seats](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260208/k10015046481000.html), crossing the two-thirds supermajority threshold that gives Takaichi unprecedented power to push through constitutional reforms and her aggressive fiscal agenda.

The opposition's collapse was equally stunning. The centrist reform coalition, led by Yoshihiko Noda and Kenta Izumi, saw its seat count [crater from](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260209/k10015047081000.html) 172 to just 49 — a devastating loss that prompted both co-leaders to announce they will [resign today](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260209/k10015047081000.html). Markets are already responding to what traders are dubbing the renewed "Takaichi trade," with the yen [weakening to](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260209/k10015047181000.html) the high 157 range against the dollar on expectations of expanded fiscal stimulus. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's weekend description of Takaichi as a "[great ally](https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxOQWFlM2h4Tm1XNzJobksxTlY3WU1pN05MdEFMbk1EVzdBRWJJSU5ZYmlrZ0JwTVhaQ2xhOVNPTF85d0Uzanhfb0h5dF9JZkNVMDBlU0JtQllKUVJJd3BfTnlnZ1BIU2kwMXBNUGhmSjJOMXpyWFlvcDJacjAzYm1CcUVhb2tjNHluNjNaeW1Ya1p4SXN5ekxvbTdoVmlaY1ZrUDVENW5VTFhZRVMy?oc=5)" signals Washington's comfort with Japan's rightward shift.

## Business & Markets

• Japan's equity markets are [set for](https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwgFBVV95cUxQbU1aTnBJV0VpMEUtX1dVcGRFUTh3Qy1vRk9XRFlFV092dHN4U3dQUmlqS0dLS2R4UmZwTUZzUE43M3E3ZzBEM094cm1jS0RaR24zckdfLWQ4MUtIVzhjejdMN1BCUlBrTTQzTVJwaEdtekhIRFpCV2tsX2I3dzFpTFJRbGt4MGpLMzlRMWVxRDhsUzEtSDBFQ1ZmbUVKNnVRTHJpQlRRMlQ0MHA0bjNZQjNIa0tYNFpmc3RRSU5nS2l2QQ?oc=5) renewed buying pressure Monday as investors price in Takaichi's stimulus promises, according to Reuters analysis.

• The Finance Ministry warned Sunday that Japan must take a "[professional approach](https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizwFBVV95cUxNaVhHM20wek9rTHF6dGJ4dnpUcEozQ0l0bi1FSjFJQXp0cXhWaHRXdktvMGtmWXRYOWd0ZjJsdkZhRVlnc0NGV3FTSHFpUERnYkYzY3VJRHlHZEtaVVRCX3Y2MU1ua0psRGs3Njh6eV92M0JEWlR3OVVFOVNFV1ZHSWN2RXZJcTF1SS1EZ3hUV0xvTUdsbWZQeHdxRVRMczNwSE9nZ0lMekl5aXJsY2JrdFBSdVo5WGo4RkQtNjY2cFNBcFZ2b0ZpRzczYUx5VGM?oc=5)" to foreign exchange reserves, suggesting caution even as political winds favor fiscal expansion.

• The yen's sharp decline reflects market expectations that Takaichi will accelerate spending programs while maintaining accommodative monetary policy to fund her economic agenda.

## Government & Policy

• Both opposition co-leaders Noda and Izumi will [formally resign](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260209/k10015047081000.html) at today's executive meeting following their party's catastrophic performance.

• The election revealed organizational weaknesses in both the LDP and smaller parties, with several groups [unable to field](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260209/k10015047191000.html) enough proportional representation candidates, effectively gifting seats to rivals.

## Coverage Flags

International outlets appear aligned with Japanese coverage on the election's significance, though Reuters is moving faster on market analysis. The scale of the opposition collapse may warrant deeper investigation into what drove such a dramatic voter shift.
