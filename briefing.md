Good morning from Tokyo. Japan is riding high at the Milan-Cortina Olympics with a trio of medals overnight, while Prime Minister Takaichi capitalizes on her landslide election victory to push through campaign promises. The momentum from her historic win is translating into both policy action and market enthusiasm, though her plans for deeper engagement with NATO on Ukraine support signal a more assertive international stance.

Snowboarder Kokomo Murase made history by winning Japan's [first Olympic gold](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260210/k10015047911000.html) in women's big air, according to NHK. Speed skater Miho Takagi claimed [bronze in](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260210/k10015047811000.html) the 1000m for her third consecutive Olympic medal in the event, while ski jumper Ren Nikaido took [bronze on](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260210/k10015047851000.html) the normal hill in his Olympic debut. The medal haul provides a welcome boost for Japan early in the Games, though veteran jumper Ryoyu Kobayashi finished a disappointing eighth in his bid for back-to-back golds.

## Government & Policy

• Japan has decided to [join NATO](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260210/k10015047881000.html) procurement framework for Ukraine support, multiple NATO officials told NHK. Japanese funds will be limited to purchasing non-lethal defense equipment under the US-led weapons acquisition program.

• Takaichi is [accelerating policy](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260210/k10015047831000.html) reviews for campaign promises including temporary food tax cuts, NHK reports. She plans careful consensus-building with opposition parties in the upper house, where the ruling coalition lacks a majority.

• The centrist opposition will [hold leadership](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260210/k10015047821000.html) elections soon after suffering major losses, with former Democratic Party executives Kenta Izumi and Junya Ogawa emerging as potential candidates, according to NHK.

## Coverage Flags

Reuters has been particularly aggressive in analyzing the China implications of Takaichi's win, noting her election victory could mean ["more beef with Beijing"](https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxOWHRHQWtsSUo2cWtIZzFYUjZkRlliWWEzcURTVFFlVG5lcFE0ZHM0SUg0aVh4aVprMEg0SGQwSGtEMERKVFB4a0ZRMnFmeVpRMHBreWl6T2UxYUpwYTdURXM4T3FraW1OSGd6bWVfNHI0dnUxOWVDaUxwZEF1Ukl3c2RoZnUxMTBQaUNHbGNqaXV3eFl5bDRZMndRalgyd0trZC15WjNZc3JMQTNj?oc=5) while Beijing predictably responded that its Japan policy would not change based on "one election." The NATO Ukraine story may warrant deeper reporting on Japan's evolving security role.
