The [Abe assassination](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260204/k10015043001000.html) case is back in the headlines as Tetsuya Yamagami's defense team filed an appeal today, challenging his life sentence for the 2022 killing of the former prime minister in Nara. The move sets up what will likely be a closely watched appeals process that could drag on for years.

Meanwhile, Japan is dealing with more immediate concerns as the country battles through what Reuters calls "[deadly winter storms](https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxOSG82VFd1ejZJNlRmMzR6Vy1BQWlkZmtGX1RfYlNacHFENmppSUtieWhoVmQxWklCeEJSY0FqU29zdm4zcHJuMGx5Nmh3U1o0WFlXVHFTTURHcXBMZ21IZ0lmVXRwcngydnpyRW5XNERyY0tWVmlxcUwwX1p2b2x3NnBBTHU3aGxVb3pDQkcyWnpaekFWNFpGOTVTWldFa0VjdC1TUmdlME1ramYy?oc=5)." NHK is warning residents today to [watch for](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260204/k10015043041000.html) falling snow from rooftops and avalanches as temperatures rise on the first day of spring. The warmer weather is creating dangerous conditions in areas already dealing with above-average snowfall.
