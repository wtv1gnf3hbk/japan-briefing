Good morning, Javier. A major legal setback hit Trump's trade agenda yesterday as the U.S. Supreme Court ruled he lacks presidential authority to impose reciprocal tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. [NHK reports](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260221/k10015057551000.html) Trump responded defiantly, vowing to sign new orders imposing a flat 10% tariff on foreign goods using different legal authorities. This comes as [Trump prepares](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260221/k10015057781000.html) for a crucial March 31-April 2 visit to China for summit talks with Xi Jinping on trade disputes and Taiwan tensions.

The timing creates fresh uncertainty for Japan Inc., which has been navigating Trump's tariff threats since his return to office. Prime Minister Takaichi has been positioning Japan as a reliable partner while warning against Chinese "coercion" in the region.
