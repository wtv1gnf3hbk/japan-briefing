Good afternoon, Javier. Here's your Tokyo briefing:

Japan woke up to a dangerous combination today: rapidly rising temperatures following one of the harshest winter seasons on record. [NHK warns](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260204/k10015043041000.html) of significant avalanche and roof collapse risks as temperatures spike above seasonal norms across regions still buried under record snowfall. The timing is particularly concerning given that soldiers and emergency crews are already [battling deadly storms](https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxOSG82VFd1ejZJNlRmMzR6Vy1BQWlkZmtGX1RfYlNacHFENmppSUtieWhoVmQxWklCeEJSY0FqU29zdm4zcHJuMGx5Nmh3U1o0WFlXVHFTTURHcXBMZ21IZ0lmVXRwcngydnpyRW5XNERyY0tWVmlxcUwwX1p2b2x3NnBBTHU3aGxVb3pDQkcyWnpaekFWNFpGOTVTWldFa0VjdC1TUmdlME1ramYy?oc=5) nationwide, according to Reuters.

The Shinzo Abe assassination case took a significant turn as defense lawyers for gunman Tetsuya Yamagami [filed an appeal](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260204/k10015043001000.html) against his life sentence. The move extends what has become Japan's most politically sensitive criminal case in decades, with the appeal likely to keep questions about religious groups and political influence in the spotlight for months to come.

**Regional Watch**
• **Australia**: The Reserve Bank [raised rates](https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE1zMkp4MHpwbGVpYXZoZnRNdmpGWGZzQUpoY1ZKanBFQ2hFbDA0anNwQ0g0emlFeVZDa2NacEVoYVFnbFBUcURqeWlrSHlPSWdsaVNtQkpwTzVmYURXMjIyaDA2Z3J5Y2pMdzFTbVZ) according to Reuters, marking another hawkish move as regional central banks grapple with persistent inflation pressures.
• **Middle East tensions**: U.S. forces [shot down](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260204/k10015042961000.html) an Iranian drone approaching a carrier in the Arabian Sea, per NHK, just as high-level U.S.-Iran talks are scheduled to proceed despite the incident.
• **Critical minerals**: Some 30 countries want to join the U.S.-led [critical minerals](https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixgFBVV95cUxOb1BZaXBTaGVGaUdWaEpad2JtSXBBZThxZjFUUTVTT2FwQURRTzFuTmhQeVJJeWVMcDdQdXNuZzk5YmpzTUs2eUl4dndNYTM2YXBsMnYtZjg3SVFwM1lJX1kxbFJIZkE2R04tM2tCdUJGUFdwbDExUUtZT1M0eG1OYlN6RXRQVkxRSWxSUjR0TGFtdFhoMmxlMHVJaUl6OEx6eGcyOFdFUENiektodlJpWDRXOEhSeFhIbnBnTnZxVGtZQTRXNkE?oc=5) club, Interior Secretary Burgum said, highlighting the growing geopolitical importance of supply chain security.

**Business & Markets**
• **Energy security**: QatarEnergy secured a major [long-term deal](https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitgFBVV95cUxQT2tXODRjaGJ2TEFMRkJrZmJSNkhWUmZKZy1rNHd1eEQwQVdMVVJTVzBaaENvVmJmRE8wOElMajdLdmxjYlpqVDd2bDBXa1hZd2drVzJZR3I4aktXelUzc0NIa2FWNTNxZktFdndubUxwWVNHcm5SN1dQM1owcmxIbW9wYXZHOS1yblJqUGN2YTdqZWdtS3lGcGRLMHFFTTVYUU9nRUVGSi1MQnlRUjVxYjQ1Z2hoUQ?oc=5) with Jera as Japan doubles down on LNG imports, Reuters reports.
• **Nintendo resilience**: The gaming giant posted [quarterly profits](https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFBVV95cUxNSm80OGREd01kblg1XzhfRXBHZ2QzdUlMaHY0RXpYd0JVRFdxNVZoT1BRSm5lcXRuTXI0V2JiaE1XTFQ2UmNqZ3RLMVFqZHJFbEtWOS04SGcyOXNPRGtWRE92RmF4MDFOaWR0Y0VnSVlvRlBTSmdBeldWaUdoWnZSQ2lCX3hobTNfcGNnVnI4OU5HYzRtQTMtSlBzUG83UnpJNDVPNUJyRFFnRFltQnRFV0FKWQ?oc=5) that beat expectations and said chip price spikes would not significantly impact operations, according to Reuters.
• **Corporate scandals**: Prudential Life Insurance Japan will [suspend sales](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260204/k10015042991000.html) of new policies for 90 days following a ¥3.1 billion employee fraud scandal, NHK reports.
• **Currency pressure**: The Prime Minister's recent [yen comments](https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiugFBVV95cUxOVk13M1NTZW9mZnNUOWRKOUVUcjNXVlBlTHBicGFkalBfcW9BdUljeVFsd0pTSEg4ajBGYUhrRi1YQm5aNHcwWlJxeS04aW5HYXhuenBJRUhhcjZITlQ3dzVkYUI3dDQ0TVVOSFU3YmpRZFFmVEx0WHFTZGc3WHR4SVBSeHJaclEwc2hHUFdvSy1VWXh5bmN5em1lLVNWbDFLbldzNTJRb3dqMS1HTkVzMDNLcXRjM1FrclE?oc=5) sent finance ministry officials scrambling, Reuters reports.

**Government & Policy**
The sketchy retirement services story is getting murkier. Police suspect the [labor union](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260204/k10015042871000.html) that allegedly received referral fees in the Momuri case was essentially a shell organization, according to NHK. This could expand into a broader investigation of how retirement service companies exploit legal loopholes.

**What to Watch**
NASA postponed the Artemis moon mission launch from February 8 to next month due to [fuel leaks](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260204/k10015043031000.html), NHK reports. While not directly Japan-focused, this affects JAXA's participation in the international lunar program.

**Coverage flags**: Reuters is notably ahead on the PM's yen comments story - worth checking if Japanese outlets are playing this down. The winter weather story seems ripe for deeper NYT coverage, especially the human cost angle that wire services aren't fully capturing.
