Good morning, Javier. Japan just made Winter Olympic history overnight, and there's significant political movement happening in Tokyo that deserves your attention.

At the Milano Cortina Olympics, 19-year-old Mari Fukada [claimed gold](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260218/k10015055581000.html) in women's snowboard slopestyle, making her the youngest Japanese woman ever to win Winter Olympic gold. Kokona Murase added bronze in the same event. This gives Japan five golds at these Games, tying the record set at Nagano 1998 on home soil. The breakthrough is particularly significant because it comes in snowboarding, a sport where Japan has been building depth for years but hadn't achieved this level of success at the Olympics.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's [second cabinet](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260219/k10015055421000.html) officially launched yesterday with her expressing strong determination to pass the fiscal year budget before March ends. This comes as Japan and the US continue expanding their strategic investment partnership, with officials now [working on](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260219/k10015055431000.html) a second round of projects that includes next-generation nuclear reactor construction. The timing is notable given broader US-Japan coordination as Trump administration tensions with Iran escalate.
