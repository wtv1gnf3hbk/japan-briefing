Good morning from Tokyo. Japan is on a medal run at the Milan-Cortina Olympics, building momentum heading into key figure skating events. The country [secured bronze](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260211/k10015048881000.html) in the mixed team ski jumping event yesterday—its first medal in this relatively new Olympic discipline—while figure skater Yuma Kagiyama [positioned himself](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260211/k10015048991000.html) strongly in second place after the men's short program.

The ski jumping triumph featured standout performances from the full Japanese squad, including Sara Takanashi and Ryoyu Kobayashi, marking a breakthrough in a sport where Japan has traditionally excelled individually but struggled in team formats. For figure skating, Kagiyama's strong opening puts him in medal contention ahead of today's free skate, though [Japan's women's ice hockey team](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/olympics/2026/02/11/smile-japan-olympics-eliminated/) faced an early Olympic exit, raising questions about the program's development compared to rapidly improving European competitors.
