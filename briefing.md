Good morning from Tokyo. Japan's Olympic momentum continues to build at the Milan-Cortina Games, but the weekend brought darker news closer to home. Ski jumper Ren Nikaido [claimed silver](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260215/k10015052121000.html) in the men's large hill event, marking his third medal of the games after earlier bronze wins in normal hill and mixed team events. The achievement comes as Japanese winter sports athletes are delivering their strongest Olympic performance in years.

That Olympic success, however, contrasts sharply with a deadly stabbing in Osaka's Dotonbori district late Saturday night. Police are hunting for a man in his twenties who [stabbed three](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260215/k10015052111000.html) teenage victims, killing a 17-year-old boy and injuring two others before fleeing the scene. The attack in one of Japan's most bustling entertainment districts underscores growing concerns about public safety, particularly as crime statistics released this weekend show [special fraud cases](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260215/k10015051951000.html) and SNS-based investment scams hit record highs last year, contributing to 770,000 reported crimes nationwide.
