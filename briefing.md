Good morning, Javier. It has been a triumphant day for Japanese winter sports at the Milano-Cortina Olympics. [Yuto Totsuka claimed](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260214/k10015051371000.html) snowboard halfpipe gold with a spectacular 95.00-point run, while 19-year-old Yamada Ryusei took bronze in his Olympic debut. The double podium finish caps what NHK is calling an "amazing" performance. Meanwhile in figure skating, [Yuma Kagiyama secured](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260214/k10015051571000.html) silver in men's singles, matching his Beijing 2022 result, with Shun Sato adding bronze for another Japanese double medal haul.

Domestically, a major police scandal is unfolding in Kanagawa Prefecture where [multiple officers face](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260214/k10015051651000.html) prosecution for fabricating traffic violation documents. The misconduct spans approximately 2,700 cases, forcing police to cancel violations and refund fines. The scale suggests systemic issues within the prefecture's traffic enforcement operations.
