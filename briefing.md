Good morning from Tokyo. Three days before the election, Japan faces an unusual winter weather crisis that has already claimed lives. Heavy snow regions in Tohoku and Niigata are experiencing [March-like temperatures](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260205/k10015043741000.html), creating dangerous conditions for roof collapses and falling snow. The situation turned deadly overnight when an [elderly man died](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260205/k10015043691000.html) in Niigata after apparently falling from his roof while clearing snow, found buried in the snow with a shovel still on the rooftop.

The weather emergency comes as Japan heads into final campaign days with unusual dynamics. Sanae Takaichi is riding a [youth-driven social media phenomenon](https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwgFBVV95cUxQdFpvVDNZYU53UXVybEFXUTRYajFFbjVyZEd4dmZ5U3ZMZWtLS3BGM2ZKVWpYN2FFdW5XZEJENzRWMXFISlJzS0docU03WENCMDNUZ0NOLWJXb1AxQTRlTUZOUC02MDd6SHFFYTZ?oc=5) into what Reuters calls a "handbags and hashtags" campaign, while markets are positioning for potential disruption. Separately, police are expanding their crackdown on the "Moumuri" job resignation service scandal, with [two lawyers](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260205/k10015043601000.html) set to face charges today for allegedly receiving illegal referral fees.

**Government & Policy**

• The House of Representatives election campaign is focusing on [corporate donations](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260205/k10015043651000.html) and electoral system reform following the LDP's political money scandals, NHK reports.

• The US-Russia New START nuclear arms treaty [expires today](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260205/k10015043701000.html), leaving no arms control framework between the world's largest nuclear powers, per NHK. Trump wants China included in future agreements but no concrete moves have emerged.

**What to Watch**

Iran's foreign minister says US-Iran [indirect talks](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260205/k10015043721000.html) will begin tomorrow in Muscat, focused on nuclear issues and sanctions relief as Trump maintains military pressure.

**Coverage Flags**

Reuters appears ahead on technical election analysis around BOJ intervention scenarios and market positioning. The Hyogo electoral district battle over Komeito voter migration could be worth deeper NYT examination given coalition dynamics.
