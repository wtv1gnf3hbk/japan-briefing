Japan's general election enters its final stretch today as campaigning officially ends, with Prime Minister Takaichi making her last appeals before Sunday's vote. The stakes are high, particularly after Donald Trump offered an unexpected [public endorsement](https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxOU3EtSGpnUTJOM2RBT3dsMGxwcUJST2w2TEp2Y25vMnU5YjFwTWM4ZkZ5Z09MZnhyYV85dkZUb08wZDFmSUZicUMtYklURTFBRDJEa1FVcWdGdFFxUEhXY2x5X1pRLVBpS3luTU55Y1h6M3FrdndZcE5mNXRBd3FadUhCS0k3c0tYSlhIUzA5ZzIwdzVEaEZYRWItdWl1SG9OSjlmLTFxZjNYVnJ2NzQxTU9n?oc=5) of Takaichi ahead of the poll. Financial markets appear to be betting on a decisive victory, with Reuters suggesting a [strong win](https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxOU3ZDODJKbzcxT2ZRaWo3Qk51ZXEyeFk4dW9nX25DeWFicHQ3dEU2SDBoaFVmMVN1R2FmZEdsUl9MVXk2dXhXRllHZUx5MGRHWTUzaUhDOF8yNTVSblRYbTdid2l4QWNodWpjU2hIOVg2YzY0SllndHFfaEt1VjlVckNEU0NfQWFUOFhhVl9SY1lkWnZFeVFvTV9vRUQzVkQtZnZmcmo3RHk0SlJYSjdDamxsWGlqNTQ?oc=5) could be the best scenario for bonds and the yen.

Adding to the drama, severe winter weather is battering Hokkaido with [blizzard conditions](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260206/k10015044601000.html), while snow is forecast to reach even Tokyo's metropolitan area over the weekend. This could complicate voter turnout on Sunday, particularly in northern regions where Takaichi's LDP traditionally holds strong support.
