Good morning from Tokyo. Japan's Olympic momentum continues to build at Milan-Cortina, with [speed skater](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260216/k10015052781000.html) Miho Takagi claiming bronze in the women's 500m early this morning — her second medal of these Games and ninth Olympic medal overall, setting a new record for most medals by a Japanese female Olympian. The [Japan Times reports](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/olympics/2026/02/16/takagi-bronze-500/) Takagi will have two more medal opportunities ahead. Meanwhile, figure skating pair Riku Miura and Ryuichi Kihara — known as "RikuRyu" — sit in fifth place after the short program following an uncharacteristic error on their signature lift, though they advance to the [free skate](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260216/k10015052871000.html) with medal hopes intact.

Domestically, a [deadly stabbing](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260216/k10015052661000.html) in Osaka's Dotonbori district has revealed new details about the group dynamics behind the attack that killed one 17-year-old and injured two others Friday night. Police say the 21-year-old suspect got into an argument with the victims while in a group of seven to eight people, highlighting ongoing concerns about youth violence in Japan's entertainment districts.
