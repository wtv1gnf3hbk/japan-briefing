Good afternoon, Javier. The big story continues to unfold around the Abe assassination case, with [defense lawyers](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260204/k10015043001000.html) for Tetsuya Yamagami filing an appeal against his life sentence this morning. This marks a significant development in what remains Japan's most consequential political crime in decades. The appeal suggests we're far from closure on a case that has exposed deep questions about security protocols and social grievances that led to the former PM's death four years ago.

Meanwhile, Japan's corporate sector is dealing with its own crisis of confidence. [Prudential Life](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260204/k10015042991000.html) announced it's suspending new contract sales for 90 days following revelations that employees embezzled ¥3.1 billion from customers. The insurance giant is promising a "fundamental overhaul" of governance and sales systems, but the scale of the misconduct raises questions about oversight across Japan's financial services industry.

**Regional Watch**

• **Iran tensions escalate**: The U.S. military [shot down](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260204/k10015042961000.html) an Iranian drone approaching an aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea, according to NHK. This comes as high-level U.S.-Iran talks remain scheduled, though Iran is reportedly demanding [venue changes](https://japantoday.com/category/world/iran-demands-changes-in-venue-and-scope-of-talks-with-us-source-says1) from Turkey to Oman.

• **Libya shock**: Seif al-Islam Gaddafi, son of the late dictator, was [reportedly killed](https://japantoday.com/category/world/seif-al-islam-gadhafi-son-of-libya%E2%80%99s-late-dictator-killed-in-north-africa-country-officials-say) in Libya, per Japan Today. This could significantly reshape the North African nation's already fragmented political landscape.

• **Ethiopia's war crimes admission**: Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed [accused Eritrean](https://japantoday.com/category/world/ethiopia%27s-prime-minister-accuses-eritrea-of-mass-killings-during-tigray-war) troops of mass killings during the Tigray war, marking the first official acknowledgment of Eritrean involvement.

**Business & Markets**

• **QatarEnergy-Jera deal**: The energy giant secured a [long-term LNG](https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitgFBVV85cUxQT2tXODRjaGJ2TEFMRkJrZmJSNkhWUmZKZy1rNHd1eEQwQVdMVVJTVzBaaENvVmJmRE8wOElMajdLdmxjYlpqVDd2bDBXa1hZd2drVzJZR3I4aktXelUzc0NIa2FWNTNxZktFdndubUxwWVNHcm5SN1dQM1owcmxIbW9wYXZHOS1yblJqUGN2YTdqZWdtS3lGcGRLMHFFTTVYUU9nRUVGSi1MQnlRUjVxYjQ1Z2hoUQ) supply contract with Japan's Jera as demand surges, per Reuters.

• **Food export surge**: Japan's agricultural exports hit [record levels](https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiugFBVV85cUxQVWZXVS1sMTlRNkFJUVI3b25jMEhqTzhEcHN2M2lxZmNZT2FQVzF4RjktdUZDaXVNMjhBX0p4VEV6OEpjdW1OMFhab0kwcEFDdnpDOFJzS2t6ZG5VZG5yRTd6aWJueTJxZ1lST0RWSTVMSkc1VUw0WEJBdXdCQWtpQ3loeXBQMUdJTzdMdkViVTZGU2dhU2I5enRoVVpEazRXWXJFd2VtLVI3c0NmZmdqZnJUa3ZZcFNpVVE) in 2025 driven by strong U.S. demand, according to Reuters.

**Government & Policy**

A more troubling domestic story involves the [job-quitting service](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260204/k10015042871000.html) "Moomuri," where executives were arrested for illegally taking referral fees from lawyers. Police discovered the payments were disguised as labor union donations, but the union appears to have been a shell organization. This highlights growing concerns about Japan's largely unregulated gig economy services.

**What to Watch**

NASA's [Artemis mission](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260204/k10015043031000.html) launch has been delayed from February 8th to next month due to fuel leak issues. While not directly Japan-focused, this affects the international lunar exploration program that includes Japanese participation through JAXA.

**Coverage Notes**: Reuters appears ahead of Japanese outlets on the PM's yen comment story and several business developments. The Prudential Life scandal might warrant deeper investigation into Japan's insurance industry oversight mechanisms.
