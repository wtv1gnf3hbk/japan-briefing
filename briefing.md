Good morning, Javier. Japan is making headlines on two fronts today: diplomatic deal-making with Trump and Olympic glory in Milan-Cortina. President Trump [announced yesterday](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260218/k10015054771000.html) that he has selected the first batch of projects for Japan's massive 80 trillion yen investment commitment to the US, focusing on oil, gas, and critical minerals ventures. The timing is strategic, coming just a month before Prime Minister Takaichi's planned White House visit. Meanwhile, Japan continues its best Olympic performance ever, with the medal count reaching 19 — surpassing the previous record from Beijing — after the women's speed skating team pursuit squad [claimed bronze](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260218/k10015054651000.html) for their third consecutive Games medal in the discipline.

The Olympic momentum builds ahead of tonight's figure skating women's free program, where 17-year-old newcomer Ami Nakai [sits atop](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260218/k10015054741000.html) the leaderboard after nailing a triple axel in her short program debut. Veteran Kaori Sakamoto trails in second, setting up what could be a Japanese one-two finish. Back home, the political machinery churns as the special Diet session convenes today to formally install Takaichi as the 105th prime minister, with her [second cabinet](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260218/k10015054631000.html) expected to take shape by evening.
