Good morning Javier. Japan secured a strong showing at the Milan-Cortina Olympics yesterday, with all four Japanese men [qualifying for](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260212/k10015049631000.html) the snowboard halfpipe finals. Most notably, defending gold medalist Ayumu Hirano advanced in seventh place despite concerns about his recovery from a bone fracture, while Ruka Hirano took second in the qualifying round. The clean sweep keeps Japan's medal hopes alive in what has been a competitive event.

On the domestic front, Japan is making a strategic push to [secure rare earth](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260212/k10015049191000.html) mining rights in Namibia after Japanese exploration confirmed significant deposits there. The government is now moving toward concrete discussions with Japanese companies about securing extraction rights, part of a broader effort to reduce dependence on Chinese rare earth supplies critical for electric vehicles and other tech applications. This comes as [Seven-Eleven adjusts](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20260212/k10015049321000.html) its food manufacturing schedule in Hokkaido, cutting daily production runs for rice balls and sandwiches from three to two due to labor shortages—a telling sign of how demographic pressures are reshaping even basic retail operations.

## What to Watch

Olympic competition continues today with the men's halfpipe finals, where Japan's four qualifiers will compete for medals. Ayumu Hirano's performance will be particularly watched given his injury recovery and status as defending champion.

## Coverage Flags

The rare earth story about Namibia appears stronger in Japanese coverage than international outlets, suggesting potential for broader regional context about Asia-Pacific resource competition. The Bangladesh election has US strategic implications that Reuters is covering more extensively than Japanese media.
